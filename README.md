i'm here i'm queer i'm starling! i mostly like building smolweb static sites, or at least ones that are free of client-side scripting. and fucking around trying to make server-side scripting stuff, most of which i do with gemini, but sometimes i like doing the normal, unholy web stuff too.

i'm very familiar with html and css. i'm also very familiar with python, mostly for non-web stuff but i've done a little bit of web app junk with it as well. i've messed with some perl and bash and wanna do more, and wanna start messing with ocaml and supercollider

i have a few projects that could stand to be on here, but i'm trying to start building better habits of um. actually managing stuff in a sensical way by learning git and github. so there's some stuff i will hopefully polish and get up here on a rainy day! but my latest wip is lipu pi sona nimi, a toki pona dictionary written entirely in toki pona, for the intermediate or advanced speaker as a reference material. right now i'm focusing on formatting it for print, but i'm gonna try and get it all pretty extensible. i'm writing it in latex, which i'm learning as i go, so that hopefully it isn't a headache later on to reformat it for polishing, as well as do cool things like make an html version or put all the data in a json file. the pdf itself and the latex source code are both available on here
